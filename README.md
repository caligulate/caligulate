- Hi all, I’m @caligulate, your standard-issue bay area autistic gay burner tech nerd.
- I'm fiercly protective of my personal privacy.
- My background:
  - Undergrad+masters in CS with a minor in math at a top 3 school.
  - Worked at a bunch of startups.
  - Was CTO of something you've heard of.
  - Worked at more than one FAANG company, been at one for well over a decade now.
  - Managed a lot of people. Very little desire to do it again.
- My focus areas:
  - Large-scale distributed systems. 
  - Emerging concurrency models (fibers, coroutines, goroutines, etc).
  - Cost and performance analysis.
  - Interviewing.
  - Inclusiveness in tech.
- Interests:
  - Cryptocurrency. 
  - Thread scheduling.
  - Effective application of cpu-local, thread-local, and atomic patterns.
  - Rethinking concurrency in the context of large numbers of cores.
  - SIMD / GPU processing.
  - I hear rust is cool.
  - ML infrastructure
    - ML itself is super-cool, but too big a commitment to learn properly.
  - Self-tuning systems.
- Primary Toolkit:
  - C++
  - SQL successors (Redshift, BigQuery, etc)
  - R
  - golang (just not on a critical path)
- Dislikes:
  - Excessive metaprogramming.
  - Java is an abomination that should be wiped from the Earth.
  - Async programming models.
  - Stop-the-world garbage collection.
    - If you think it's OK for your binary to randomly pause for 10ms (golang) or 13 years (java), we have nothing to discuss.
  - Weakly-typed languages.
  - Whoever decided to change python from a solid, highly readable/highly usable language to decorator hell.
  - Opinionated IDEs.
